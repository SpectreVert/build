Abstract
--------
This is a simple header that provides tools for compiling C source code files
and linking binaries. It follows a simple dependency and compilation model. It
should be used if you want to avoid tools like `make` or `cmake` but still need
a somewhat coherent incremental compilation.

Usage
-----
The library uses `Build_Node` to express a component that is either a batch of C source code files, or a binary. Each `Build_Node` can depend on a number of
different `Build_Node`.

A `Build_Node` that has one or more dependencies will be recompiled whenever
it's dependencies have been updated.

A good usage of this architecture is for instance to make two separate batches
of files, one with headers and one with source code, and setting a dependency
on the headers batch for the sources batch. That way, whenever a header is
modified, all source files will be forced to recompile, even when they have
not been modified.

Consult `demo.c` to have an overview of the available commands.

Todo
----

* finish some features (circular dep checking...)
* upgrade README (rules of thumb, documentation of the main functions...)
* add Library to be able to compile and depend on libraries.
